# EV-revolution-Pathway-to-SDG7
The journey toward a sustainable future is a story of innovation, collaboration, and transformation. 
At its heart lies SDG7—the United Nations’ goal to ensure access to affordable, reliable, and 
modern energy for all. This vision encompasses clean energy systems that align human progress 
with environmental stewardship, addressing one of the most pressing challenges of our time: the 
shift from usage of fossil energy power to renewable energy sources in the world (An et al., 2024).  
Unwinding to SDG7 is not an event but a process: steps in the right direction and innovation and 
collaboration are the key decision-points. Herein lies the origin of a new pathway of transformative 
transport: the path thus becomes the pivotal chapter of transport 
In this story, the role of transport turns into a critical section. These ICE vehicles have for the past 
few decades been instrumental in increasing the emission of greenhouse gases, air pollution, as 
well as increasing energy insecurity (Cho et al., 2024). While these vehicles have not only 
advanced climatic change but also linked economies with uncertain, depletable resources, entailing 
both environmental and geo-political factors.  
Coming into the picture, electric vehicles or rather otherwise referred to as EVs-a disruptive 
solution that erases the history of transport. EVs represent moving from technologies that harm 
the environment to technologies for sustainable development, embracing opportunities to lower 
emissions, enhance the quality of the environment as well as investing in other renewable systems. 
Beyond their role in combating climate change, EVs represent a broader transition: as a positive 
shift toward energy liberation globally, economic balance, and environmental sustainability.
